## Questions

1. Whenever I clicked on the map, the white border highlight changed depending on the state. Some have a thicker white border, while others have a more subtle border. I wondered if it was due to the map JSON I used.
2. Another question concerns the description. I received a 0.5 point deduction from my static project for narrative, which I hope to improve in this project. In my case, I wondered if there was any additional information or context I should include to strengthen the narrative.
