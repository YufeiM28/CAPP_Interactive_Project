## Description

Using the data on birth rate of teenage girls, I am planning to map out the longitudinal changes in the U.S. In terms of the interactive feature, audiences would be able to click on a specific state and to learn more about the data regarding to its yearly changes. On the other hand, audiences could also select which year they want to focus more on by getting a glimpse of the density map of birth rate across states.

## Technical Plan re: Option A/B/C/D

I’m choosing Option C (Geospatial Visualization) because my dataset is inherently spatial (state/county birth rates across years), and a map is the most direct way to surface geographic patterns and let users dive into regions they care about. As recommended, I am planning to use MapLibreGL for the base map. To fulfill the requirement of using D3, I would build a line chart of birth rate over time for the selected state.
